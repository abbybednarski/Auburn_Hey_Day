# Auburn Hey Day

Hey Day is a tradition among the Auburn community that brings people together. Hey Day began after WWII to make students coming back from war feel welcome on campus. That means this tradition has been going on for **_77 years_**! 

Now, student government hand out name tags for people to wear so passersby can say "Hi" to each other. This tradition is beloved by the Auburn community for bringing everyone closer together.
