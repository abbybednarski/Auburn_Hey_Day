# Auburn_Hey_Day

Hey Day began after WWII to make people coming back from war feel welcome on campus. That means this tradition has been going on for **_77_** years! Now, student government hand out name tags for people to wear so passersby can say hi to each other. Over the years, this tradition has brought the Auburn community closer together.
